# Lee McManus - Data_Analysis_Portfolio
# About
Hi, I'm Lee! I have an analytical background in Chemistry and a Diploma of Higher Education in Mathematical Sciences. My strong foundation in STEM, combined with a passion for data-driven insights, has led me to explore the dynamic fields of data analysis and data science. I am eager to apply my technical and analytical skills as an entry-level data specialist.

Throughout my studies, I have developed a keen ability to work with complex data, identifying patterns and trends with precision. My experience includes, data management, and statistical analysisâ€”skills that I believe will be invaluable in a data-driven role.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, continuously seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge. Whether collaborating in a team or working independently, I thrive on uncovering meaningful insights and solving complex problems through data.

This repository serves as a space to showcase my skills, share projects, and track my progress in Data Analytics and Data Science.
